COMPILING BLAHTEX
=================

Under Linux, just run "make" at the command line, or if you're feeling energetic, "make linux".

For Mac OS X, use "make mac".

I have compiled it on Solaris with additional effort. Please contact me if you are interested.

*Please* contact me if you have trouble compiling on Linux or Mac OS X.


RUNNING BLAHTEX
===============

Just type "blahtex -help" at the command line. It will carefully explain the syntax.
